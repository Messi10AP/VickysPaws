# VickysPaws

Approximately a year ago, a Siberian husky puppy was rescued from certain death. Victoria was born disabled, with stubs on her back legs instead of paws. The breeder was not able to sell her, so he set her free. However, unable to take care of herself, Victoria kept coming back to the breeder in Puerto Rico. The breeder had enough and threatened to shoot Victoria to death if no one adopted her. Upon hearing of her imminent perpetual rest, she was flown from Puerto Rico to a shelter in Old Bridge, New Jersey, the Husky House. She was quickly taken into a foster home. 


Tara Anderson, of 3D Systems, has designed a prosthetic for a dog named Derby. After reaching out to her, she has offered to aid us in designing the prosthetics for Victoria. So, now, the 3D printing of prosthetics is a challenge that the Academy students who are members of the Computer Science Club will partake in. A select group of students will go through the process of designing and printing the prosthetics in order to better the little husky's life, ultimately preventing a painful ending for Victoria of scoliosis and hip dysplasia.
